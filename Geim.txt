					Custom Geim

1. Setting:
   Town with a bunch of NPCs – wander around (make as random as possible). OR make recognizable npcs do different jobs (farmers/shop/caravan drivers)
       AIs which control the environment:
o Open/Close Gates
o Markets to buy items => required by some NPCs to be bribed?/ Can hire sappers ( MUST HAVE TECHIES) to destroy walls.
o Raise bridges
Environment:
	Invisibility
(Feels weird)Fog of War => disabled by Light sources/Lamps around the map (there are probably props for those)
NPCs can be hired by Guards to ‘pose’ as bribable NPCS creating an alert for the guards when someone tries to bribe that NPC.
